<body>
<p>Hello, my name is Giovanni Quizhpi.</p>
<p>My ethnicity is Ecuadorian, and my family comes from a city called Guayaquil.</p>
<p>I am currently studying software engineering/development at IIT, and I gradated from VonSteuben High School.</p>
<p>I grew up on the south side of chicago until I was 5 years old. We moved out to the poor north side around Albany park and from there I lived until I graduated highschool. Living in the rougher parts of chicago made me realize early on, the value of hard work and putting in the energy to become successful. I'm working hard for my family to make them proud and to prove to myself that I can be somebody.</p>
